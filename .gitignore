# Data files (often large or regenerated)
# Consider ignoring large datasets or intermediate processing files
# if they can be regenerated from source data.
# For example:
# /data/
# *.csv
# *.json
# *.pkl
# *.hdf5
# *.h5

# Miscellaneous
# If you use popular IDEs like PyCharm, VS Code, etc., uncomment their specific ignore lines:
# .idea/             # PyCharm project files
.vscode/           # VS Code settings (uncomment if you want to ignore)
